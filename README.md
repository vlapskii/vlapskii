Oh, hi!

### About me
I'm self-taught dev since 201(?) (my previous github account was deleted), but I hasn't been very active for this all time by various reasons (includes lazy). For moment at writing this markdown, I studying at the university college.

Skills:
* not advanced iOS applications
* a little bit linux administration (at closed very small design studio)
* not advanced programming in cpp
* Lua (thanks to OpenComputers), Python (often used to school&college for resolving problems), and a little bit Rust
